The ratio of the number of points inside the circle to the total number of points is an estimate of $\\frac{\\pi r^{2}}{(2r)^{2}} = \\frac {\\pi}{4}$."

    "The analysis of the probability of winning in a simplified Mensch game is done in this part. The game consists of a board with 40 spaces, and the goal is to move the only piece each player has from the start to the end. The start and end spaces differ for each player. The game is played with a dice, and the player can move the piece the number of spaces that the dice shows. The game has some special rules, like the possibility of eating the opponent's piece if it lands on the same space. Also for bringing the piece to the start space, the player needs to roll a 6. The probability of winning is calculated by simulating the game many times and counting the number of wins for each player."

    "As we can see, the probability of winning is very close to 0.25 for each player. Thث wining probability increases for the players who start sooner, but the difference is very small. We assume that the reason for this is that the first players have a higher chance of starting the game sooner and thus have a higher chance of winning. If we increase the board size, the probability of winning will be closer to 0.25 for each player. In this case, the significance of the starting position will decrease."
